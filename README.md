# idp-gitops

GitOps source of truth for the IDP EKS cluster. Argo CD watches this repo; nothing is
applied by hand.

No `kind: Secret` lives in this repo: ESO creates `feature-flag-secrets` at runtime from
AWS Secrets Manager (`idp/db-creds`, `idp/jwt-secret`, `idp/valkey`).

## Validation and branch rules

Every push and PR runs `scripts/validate.sh` (`.github/workflows/validate.yml`): each overlay is
rendered with Kustomize and checked with kubeconform (strict) against the Kubernetes 1.35 and
CRD schemas. `main` is protected by a ruleset: no force-push or deletion, and changes land
through a PR with the `validate` check green. The CI bot and Backstage GitHub Apps bypass the
ruleset (they write generated, pre-validated changes); humans go through PRs.
